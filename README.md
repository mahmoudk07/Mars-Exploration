# Mars-Exploration
### Description:
#### In the hope of getting to know more about Mars and the possibility of life on its surface, a huge number of exploratory missions to different regions of the planet need to be conducted. Imagine (at some future time) that we have several rovers of different types and capabilities on the surface of Mars ready to carry out missions to its different regions. There is also a hypothetical base station which acts as the central point from which the different rovers begin their exploratory missions and to which they return after mission completion. The base station basically assigns missions to the different rovers. this Program used to simulate the mission assignment process and calculates some related statistics in order to help improve the overall process.
#### *************************************************************************************************
### Missions:
#### Formulation Day: the day when the mission formulation is finalized and the mission becomes ready to be assigned to a rover.
#### Mission Type: There are 3 types of missions: Emergency, Mountainous and Polar missions.
####     1- Emergency missions must be assigned first before mountainous and polar missions.
####     2- Mountainous missions are missions to mountainous regions of Mars and must be conducted by rovers equipped to navigate in such regions.
####     3- Polar missions are missions to the polar ice caps of Mars and must be conducted by rovers equipped to navigate in such regions.
#### Target Location: The distance (in kilometers) from the base station to the target location of the mission.
#### Mission Duration: The number of days needed to fulfill the mission requirements at the target location (assumed constant regardless of rover type).
#### Significance: A number representing the importance of the mission and how beneficial it is (the higher the number, the more significant it is).
#### *************************************************************************************************
### Rovers:
#### Rover Type: There are 3 types of rovers: Emergency rovers, Mountainous rovers, and Polar rovers.
#### 1-Emergency rovers are rovers which are over-equipped and ready for emergency missions in almost any region.
#### 2-Mountainous rovers are rovers which can navigate in mountainous regions.
#### 3-Polar rovers are rovers which can navigate in polar regions.
#### Checkup Duration: The duration (in days) of checkups that a rover needs to perform after completing N missions.
#### Speed: in kilometers/hour. (Note that a day on Mars is 25 hours.)
