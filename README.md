# Mars-Exploration
### Description:
#### In the hope of getting to know more about Mars and the possibility of life on its surface, a 
#### huge number of exploratory missions to different regions of the planet need to be conducted. 
#### Imagine (at some future time) that we have several rovers of different types and capabilities on the 
#### surface of Mars ready to carry out missions to its different regions. There is also a hypothetical 
#### base station which acts as the central point from which the different rovers begin their exploratory 
#### missions and to which they return after mission completion. The base station basically assigns 
#### missions to the different rovers.  
#### this Program used to simulate the mission assignment process and calculates
#### some related statistics in order to help improve the overall process.
